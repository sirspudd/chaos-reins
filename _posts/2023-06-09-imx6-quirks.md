# SDMA reboot under io load

In the 4.9 tree associated with my device, imx/sdma/sdma-imx6q.bin is by default a built in piece of firmware with version number 3.3; when this is loaded in place of the upstream (linux-firmware equivalent but delivered by URL directly from the nxp site) firmware, the system will demonstrate some insane behavior, notably rebooting (no panic, no logs) on high IO load.
