# TL&DR

Everything can be trivially made to work but the Validity fingerprint sensor.

* Wifi requires
  * ideapad_laptop to remove the hardware block (present in 4.9 tree), blacklisting this module in 4.8 removes the hardware block, but might carry other costs
  * Firmware

# Dropkicking Windows

1. Get to the EFI/bios configuration. I got there via going to recovery options in Windows and rebooting to the EFI settings panel. I could not get there via any other mechanism. Once in the bios, enable AHCI support for the disk, disable secure boot and reset setup keys. (I had to do this in order for the Linux kernel to boot, or it would ceaselessly prompt me to add the kernel hash to the EFI array of trusted hashes.
2. After this, a standard Arch boot [stick](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media) will get you to the command line (this assumes no mode setting, as mode setting on this hardware introduces artifacts unless you pass enable_rc6=0 on the kernel cmdline)
