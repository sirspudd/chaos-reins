# Overview

What with the Yoga 900/710 debacle, it was fairly unclear for me whether or not I would be able to change between the notorious raid controller and ahci. Turns out on the 910 this is not an issue (as reflected by one Lenovo page I happened to stub my toe on, on one of the googling sessions). This blog deals with quirks in the i915 and wifi driver which can both be time sinks.

# TL&DR

* Everything can be trivially made to work but the Validity fingerprint sensor.
* Wifi requires
  * ideapad_laptop to remove the hardware block (present in 4.9 tree), blacklisting this module in 4.8 removes the hardware block, but might carry other costs
  * Firmware from this [repo](https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware) which replaces the crap in /usr/lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0. (Don't worry, this muppet is the canonical source of firmware for these cards)
* Video requires enable_rc6=0 to avoid booting to skittish artifacts (or no modesetting, but that is way more intrusive)
* Machine runs well and looks good. Ain't got shit on a Carbon X1.
* Volume out of speakers is pitiful even at max. Watching movies outside of soundproof box is impossible.

# Verbose instructions

1. Get to the EFI/bios configuration. I got there via going to recovery options in Windows and rebooting to the EFI settings panel. I could not get there via any other mechanism. Once in the bios, enable AHCI support for the disk, disable secure boot and reset setup keys. (I had to do this in order for the Linux kernel to boot, or it would ceaselessly prompt me to add the kernel hash to the EFI array of trusted hashes.)
2. After this, a standard Arch boot [stick](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media) will get you to the command line (this assumes no mode setting, as mode setting on this hardware introduces artifacts unless you pass enable_rc6=0 on the kernel cmdline). Follow the install instructions as per usual.
3. I used a wired network to do the initial provisioning as documented in the Arch install documentation. Interesting with one usb port, no hub and both a usb flashstick and a usb NIC. Awesome. I personally used an [ArchBoot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archboot) iso as it loads itself entirely into memory, freeing up the USB port for the NIC.
4. I personally recommend systemd-bootd, here is my Arch boot entry:/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf:

        title arch
        linux /vmlinuz-linux
        initrd /intel-ucode.img
        initrd /initramfs-linux.img
        options root=PARTUUID=8457d2b8-ba4a-4f9b-9098-03241bdbd20f rw i915.enable_rc6=0 pci=noaer quiet splash

5. Wifi is the only sticking point as noted above, and requires you to address both points articulated above. This is what healthy dmesg output for the ath10k module looks like:

        [    3.425555] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: pci irq msi oper_irq_mode 2 irq_mode 0 reset_mode 0

        [    6.005216] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0 wlp1s0: renamed from wlan0

6. I kept on chasing the firmware-5.bin dragon for a while, but wifi works, so who gives a flying fig. The output of rfkill is way more important, as the hardware lock ends all dialogue.
7. Those complications aside, everything is working and functioning at peak performance.

# Comments

* My Backspace key arrived feeling slightly broken and lopsided. Anything other than a direct strike failed to register on the key, and pressing on the bottom makes the top rise up, which feels a little broken.
* Touchpad feels good, screen looks good if a little glossy. Gnome looks really good at 1080p on a 13.9 inch screen
* Function keys are inverted by default and I have not established how to flip that at a system wide level

# Review

* Yoga 910 is pretty fucking nice. The hinge is quite spiffy, but is really kinda academic if you have zero intention of using the device for its 2-in-1 functionality. I am actually disabling the touchscreen with supreme prejudice since I have never seen a beneficial touch experience in Linux. (Outside of Android)
* Carbon X1 gen 2 kicked the shit out of this device. Keyboard is incomparably good, and I don't find the bezel difference on the screens enough of a perk to even tilt my head in that direction. The bezel on the X1 ain't bad at all.

# Compilation

## Linux

```
* MAKEFLAGS=-j5
* make localmodconfig
* make clean (git clean -xdff, with the .config preserved)
* time make

real    7m52.257s
user    28m7.763s
sys 1m35.333s

Lenovo also has a high performance mode (vs balanced) which I enabled in the bios before repeating this compile just to see the impact

Graphical corruption when _wifi_ firmware is present and i915.enable_rc6 is not explicitly disabled.
