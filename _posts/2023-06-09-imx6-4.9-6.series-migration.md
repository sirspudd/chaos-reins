# CAAM api change

caam_jr_enqueue, a function which once returned 0 on success now returns a non-zero value for a pending transaction and existing logic being forward ported was breaking as a result; the kernel was consistently panicking. The resulting splatter made recognizing the issue surprisingly tricky. Luckily I ran into this:

[https://github.com/usbarmory/caam-keyblob/issues/11](https://github.com/usbarmory/caam-keyblob/issues/11)

in particular this glorious mofo:

[https://github.com/usbarmory/caam-keyblob/issues/11#issuecomment-955053044](https://github.com/usbarmory/caam-keyblob/issues/11#issuecomment-955053044)

who shared this:

```
I think, the problem lies in
https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/caam-keyblob/blob/2e303fa357f6ec69199ba6e45ae9e9088a43ca3b/caam_keyblob.c#L413
and
https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/caam-keyblob/blob/2e303fa357f6ec69199ba6e45ae9e9088a43ca3b/caam_keyblob.c#L513

The return behavior of caam_jr_enqueue slightly changed in kernel 5.7. When
previously it returned 0 on success, it now returns EINPROGRESS:
torvalds/linux@4d370a1#diff-8acc41c534456288daba59a125ddb3f779635dc493ff4888545adbf1dd0a17c1R417
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/4d370a1036958d7df9f1492c345b4984a4eba7f6/drivers/crypto/caam/jr.c#L417

Accordingly, the next lines should not be
if(!res) {
but
if(res == -EINPROGRESS) {

It's probably just this fix in line
https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/caam-keyblob/blob/2e303fa357f6ec69199ba6e45ae9e9088a43ca3b/caam_keyblob.c#L415
and
https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/caam-keyblob/blob/2e303fa357f6ec69199ba6e45ae9e9088a43ca3b/caam_keyblob.c#L515

Unfortunately, I don't have any hardware available to test and debug right now,
so I'll have to leave the actual fix to someone else.

Which swiftly led to cthulu's noodle appendages retreating from my personal foreground as doors opened.

# dtb loadaddr suddenly needs to be specified

Another issue I hit was that my device would not longer boot. The device died
at:

```
Starting Linux ...
```

if you enabled early printk, you then get to see roughly this

```
Starting kernel ...

You should read the NXP thread:

[https://community.nxp.com/t5/i-MX-Processors/Kernel-bump-from-3-0-35-to-5-10/td-p/1539576](https://community.nxp.com/t5/i-MX-Processors/Kernel-bump-from-3-0-35-to-5-10/td-p/1539576)

I did not find the responses particularly helpful.

My dtb which is packed in a fitimage appeared to now suddenly be being unpacked to a bogus location. Kind odd bug to hit when jumping kernel versions. This intepretation was bolstered by the fact NFS booting the same kernel with an explicitly placed version of the same device tree was working. I assumed some secondary mechanism had previously been making this work, despite a malconfigured (turns out an actually absent) fitimage loadaddr. Introducing an explicit loadaddr to the dtb entry in fitimage config did acually end up resolving the issue and the kernel proceeded to boot.
