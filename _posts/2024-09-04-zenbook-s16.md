# Overview

I am still seeking a reasonable alternative to desktop hardware to be able to develop/compile on the go. This is something of a fool's errand; I am not hoping for parity, I am just hoping for something less aggregious than the delta I have experienced to date.

I was moving from a Lenovo Z16; nominally a high end device which got a lot of firmware updates delivered via fwupdate which was awesome. What was less awesome was the absurd bios delay ahead of each and every boot, the battery being dead after any period of rest, coupled with large charge times and non-reponsive hardware which made each and every use into a chore. I had installed Fedora on this device under some pretence that some of the legwork would be done by the distro and the manufacturer, but there was no win, and the disparity with Apple laptops makes it hard not to weep.

Running from this reality, I opted for a pretty minimalist configuration from ASUS. I don't want a discrete GPU, I do want a laptop which can compile and ideally be used for a couple hours before charging (not when engaging in compilation, but general usage). Since using Fedora on my last laptop gained me nothing, I went back to the arms of Arch.

The appeal of this laptop was the lack of discrete GPU; I was more than a bit of a muppet to forgo the full 12 cores of the 370 (2 efficiency cores, 4 threads), and I was also probably a muppet forgoing the 54W given the amount of time spent compiling crud as part of my daily job.

## Setup

There were very few gotchas. I went through the standard Arch motions, and would have had my system at a reasonable point in 30 min if I had not run afoul of populating my rootfs with pacstrap before syncing my clock. This led to the usual gpg fuckery that googling said issue is choked with.

## Outcome

### Negative

* subset of speakers are clearly functional. The volume is laughable after using a M1 Max based Macbook pro. This issue is still present with 6.11.0-rc5, I am hoping the next merge window addresses it.
* the machine deadlocks every couple of hours; sshing in is impossible
* the machine only supports s2idle; I have yet to get it hibernating successfully.

### Positive

* The screen is gorgeous
* The framerate makes KDE Plasma 6 feel sexier than ever before
* wake from sleep is fast as hell

# Benchmarking

## Linux v6.11-rc6

```
make defconfig
time make

make  2284.91s user 108.71s system 1702% cpu 2:20.59 total

(Same result as phoronix unsurprisingly)
```

# Misc output

cat /sys/power/mem_sleep

[s2idle]
