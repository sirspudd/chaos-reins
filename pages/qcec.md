# Overview

* [QCEC](https://github.com/sirspudd/qcec) implements a libCEC based HDMI-CEC input plugin for Qt
* licensed as per usual with Qt modules. libCEC is available under a dual GPL/commercial license. Speak to them.
* QCEC is packaged as part of the QPi Arch Linux repo for the Raspberry Pi series of devices.
* Don't expect CEC to work in conjunction with an arbitrary HDMI hub
* If code quality improves, I might attempt to upstream this. That said, there is now official API in the kernel for HDMI-CEC, which might provide a better/cleaner interface for our needs.
