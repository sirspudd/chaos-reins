# Chaos Reins

My name is Donald Carr; I operate a software consultancy company based in San Francisco, specializing in:

* Qt/QML
* All things (Embedded) Linux

here is my [CV](https://github.com/sirspudd/cv/raw/master/carbon/donald-carr-cv.pdf)

I am equally comfortable writing Qt apps, doing board bring up and Qt integration, and tailoring Qt to a chosen hardware solution. If you want to ship an independent Linux appliance or device, I am a useful man to talk to. Available for short or long term contract.
