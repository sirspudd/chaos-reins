# Chaos Reins

My name is [Donald Carr](https://github.com/sirspudd/cv/raw/master/carbon/donald-carr-cv.pdf), I operate a software consultancy company based in San Francisco, specializing in:

* Qt
* (Embedded) Linux

If you want to ship an independent Linux appliance/device, I am a useful man to talk to. Available for short/long term contract.
