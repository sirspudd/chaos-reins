My name is Donald Carr; I am a [Rhodes scholar](https://www.ru.ac.za/) (literally, though we prefer the term "Rhodent"). I am the founder of a software consultancy company based in San Francisco, specializing in Qt/QML and all things (Embedded) Linux. My CV can be found [here](https://github.com/sirspudd/cv/raw/master/carbon/donald-carr-cv.pdf) and our services are enumerated [here](http://chaos-reins.com/services)
