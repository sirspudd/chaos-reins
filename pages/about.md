# Chaos Reins

My name is Donald Carr, here is my [CV](https://github.com/sirspudd/cv/raw/master/carbon/donald-carr-cv.pdf); I operate a software consultancy company based in San Francisco, specializing in:

* Qt/QML
* All things (Embedded) Linux

I am equally comfortable writing Qt apps, doing board bring up/integration and/or tailoring Qt to a particular SOC/hardware solution. If you want to ship an independent Linux appliance/device, I am a useful man to talk to. Available for short/long term contract.
